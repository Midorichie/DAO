# Stacks DAO Smart Contract

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) implementation built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This DAO enables community-driven decision-making through a sophisticated governance system with weighted voting, treasury management, and delegate voting capabilities.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Membership Management**
  - Flexible stake-based membership system
  - Minimum stake requirement: 100,000 STX
  - Ability to increase stake
  - Stake-weighted voting power using square root calculation
  - Member profiles with historical data

- **Proposal System**
  - Multiple proposal types (Treasury/Governance)
  - Customizable proposal duration
  - Automated proposal execution
  - Quorum-based decision making
  - Detailed proposal tracking

- **Voting Mechanism**
  - Weighted voting based on stake
  - Delegate voting system
  - Anti-plutocracy measures
  - Vote history tracking
  - Time-bound voting periods

- **Treasury Management**
  - Secure fund handling
  - Balance tracking
  - Automated execution of treasury proposals
  - Multiple signature requirements for large transactions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stacks-dao.git
cd stacks-dao
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
```

3. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet contract-deploy dao-contract
```

## Usage

### Joining the DAO

```clarity
;; Stake STX and join the DAO
(contract-call? .dao-contract join-dao u100000)
```

### Creating a Proposal

```clarity
;; Create a new proposal
(contract-call? .dao-contract create-proposal 
    "Proposal Title"
    "Proposal Description"
    "TREASURY"
    'SP000...
    u1000
    "execute-function"
)
```

### Voting on Proposals

```clarity
;; Vote on a proposal
(contract-call? .dao-contract vote u1 true)
```

### Delegating Votes

```clarity
;; Delegate voting power
(contract-call? .dao-contract delegate-vote 'SP000...)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Test Coverage
- Membership functions
- Proposal creation and execution
- Voting mechanics
- Treasury operations
- Delegation system
- Security constraints

## Security Considerations

1. **Stake Management**
   - Secure stake deposit and withdrawal
   - Protected treasury operations
   - Multiple validation checks

2. **Voting Security**
   - Prevention of double voting
   - Time-bound voting periods
   - Delegate verification

3. **Proposal Safety**
   - Execution validation
   - Quorum requirements
   - Treasury balance checks
